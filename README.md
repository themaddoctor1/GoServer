# GoServer

This repository contains a basic server that I wrote to teach myself a bit about NodeJS. I used it merely to try out some of the concepts behind the software, which is why there are some non-ideal approaches that I've taken to handle some aspects of the program.

My true objective with the project was to create an application that would allow me to play what I consider to be an interesting game. Development involved several challenges, including determining which pieces should be removed from a board.

The server is written using NodeJS with socket.io, and utilizes HTML and CSS to present the topic on the client side.

## How to use

The code can be setup and run with:

```
$ npm install
$ nodejs server.js
```
